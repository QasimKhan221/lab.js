Q1: Why didn't we use sudo before node lab.js in this case?
   A1: We didn't use sudo because lab.js is a local file. We dont need permission for it.


Q2: What does Lab.js do?
A2: It helps read the contents of plain.txt asynchronously. After reading its content, it prints it out on the console.

Q3: Why does ************after readFile************
    appear before the contents or plain.txt in the output while the call to readFile is before 
    the console.log call that prints this line.
A3: It apperas because the code doesn't wait for the file to read. It executes it immediately.

Q4: What does the function toString('utf8') do?
A4: It basically changes the raw file to readable text string for us. When deleted, it changed it into numbers.
